üè¶ Banking Analytics Project Report
üìå Problem Statement:-

The bank was struggling to fully understand customer behavior and product utilization across its portfolio of 3,000+ clients. 

Key challenges included:

No clear segmentation of customers by income, loyalty tier, or risk weighting.\
Limited visibility into loan, deposit, and credit card ownership by demographics (gender, nationality, occupation).\
Difficulty identifying high-value clients with untapped opportunities, such as those holding large deposits but no loans.\
Lack of consolidated reporting on advisor (banking contact) performance.\
Limited insights into cross-selling and retention opportunities.\
These gaps made it harder for the bank to design targeted financial products, reduce risk, and improve customer engagement.

üîß My Input (Work Contribution):-

To address these problems, I designed a complete data analytics solution using SQL, Python, and Power BI:\
SQL (Data Preparation & Segmentation)\
Built multiple views such as income_classification, card_user_by_gender, credit_risk, customer_classification, unaware_customers.\
Segmented customers by income levels, loyalty tiers, gender, and risk profiles.\
Highlighted cross-sell opportunities (e.g., high deposits but zero loans).\
Python (Exploratory Data Analysis ‚Äì EDA)\
Performed correlation analysis (heatmap) to identify links between deposits, savings, loans, and credit card balances.\
Analyzed income distribution to identify the dominant customer segment (Mid-income).\
Explored demographic trends such as nationality and age vs. financial behavior.\
Power BI (Visualization & Business Insights)\
Designed interactive dashboards showing deposits, loans, KPIs, and segmentation.\
Created clear visual storytelling for business users to track performance.\
Developed KPI cards (Total Deposits, Total Loans, Clients, Assets) for quick decision-making.\
